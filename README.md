To access public page likes, comments, and shares using Facebook Graph API, you'll need the **public_basic_information** permission when creating your access token. 

Here's a breakdown:

* **Permission:** public_basic_information
* **Description:** This permission allows access to basic information about a public page, including its name, ID, category, and whether the user has liked the page.

**Obtaining an Access Token:**

1. Visit the Facebook Developers website: [https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/)
2. Create a new app if you haven't already.
3. In "Graph API Explorer", select the desired version (e.g., v16.0).
4. Enter a public Facebook page URL (e.g., [https://www.facebook.com/pages](https://www.facebook.com/pages)).
5. Click "Get Access Token" and choose the **public_basic_information** permission.
6. The generated access token allows you to make requests to the Graph API for public data accessible with this permission.

**Important Notes:**

* You cannot access private information like comments or likes from specific users with this permission. It focuses on publicly available data about the page.
* Facebook's Graph API and permissions might change over time. Refer to the official documentation for the latest information: [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/guides/access-tokens/](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/guides/access-tokens/)
* Consider implementing rate limiting to avoid exceeding Facebook's usage limits for API calls.

* Here are some examples of public Facebook pages you can use for testing purposes (subject to change):

Facebook Official Page: https://www.facebook.com/
NASA: https://www.facebook.com/NASA/
BBC News: https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews/


Here's a guide for your next steps in building your application to access public Facebook page data:

**1. Create a Facebook Developer App:**

* Visit the Facebook Developers website: [https://developers.facebook.com/](https://developers.facebook.com/)
* Click "My Apps" and then "Create App".
* Choose a name for your app and select the appropriate category (we discussed this earlier - choose "Consumer").

**2. Enable Public Data Access Permission:**

* In your app dashboard, navigate to "Settings" -> "Basic".
* Under "Products", locate "Facebook Login" and click "Settings".
* Disable "Facebook Login" since you don't need user login for public data access.
* Go back to "Settings" and navigate to "Products" -> "Public Data Access".
* Click "Settings" and enable the "public_basic_information" permission. This allows you to access basic information about public pages.

**3. Obtain an Access Token:**

* In the Facebook Developers website's "Graph API Explorer" ([https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/)), select the desired version (e.g., v16.0).
* Enter a public Facebook page URL (e.g., [https://www.facebook.com/NASA/](https://www.facebook.com/NASA/)).
* Click "Get Access Token" and choose the "public_basic_information" permission (you already enabled this in your app settings).
* Copy the generated access token. This token will be used in your application to make API calls.

**4. Develop your Application:**

* Utilize the chosen programming language (e.g., Node.js) and libraries (e.g., request) to make API calls to the Facebook Graph API.
* Construct your application logic to handle user input (e.g., a form where users enter a public Facebook page URL).
* Use the access token and the entered URL to make a request to the Graph API endpoint for retrieving likes, comments, shares, and follower count (consider using separate requests for each metric).
* Parse the JSON response from the API and display the retrieved data in a user-friendly format within your application.

**5. Testing and Deployment:**

* Test your application with various public Facebook page URLs to ensure it retrieves data correctly.
* Implement error handling to gracefully handle scenarios where the provided URL might not be a valid public page.
* Consider security best practices to store and handle the access token securely within your application.
* If intended for public use, deploy your application to a suitable hosting platform.

**Additional Resources:**

* Facebook Graph API Explorer: [https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/)
* Facebook Graph API Documentation: [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/)
* Public Data Access Permission: [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/)

Remember, Facebook's Graph API and permissions might change over time. Refer to the official documentation for the latest information. This guide provides a starting point, and you can customize it further based on your specific project requirements and chosen programming language.


The text explains steps related to configuring your Facebook developer app to access public data from Facebook pages. The image you sent is not directly relevant to these steps, but I can still explain the text in relation to the overall process of creating a Facebook developer app.

**Here's a breakdown of the text:**

1. **Locating "Products" and "Facebook Login" settings:**
   - This refers to navigating within the Facebook developer app dashboard. There should be a section where you can manage different products or features your app can integrate with. Look for a section named "Products" and within that, find settings related to "Facebook Login".

2. **Disabling "Facebook Login" (Optional):**
   - Since you're only interested in public data, you don't need users to log in with their Facebook accounts. Disabling "Facebook Login" ensures your app won't prompt users for login when it retrieves public page information.

3. **Enabling "Public Data Access":**
   - This is the crucial step for allowing your app to access public data. Navigate back to "Products" and look for a section or setting related to "Public Data Access". Clicking "Settings" within that section should allow you to enable the necessary permissions.

4. **"Public Basic Information" Permission:**
   - By enabling "public_basic_information" permission, you grant your app the ability to access basic details about public pages on Facebook. This includes information like the page's name, ID, category, and whether the user has liked the page (but not the total number of likes).

**Overall, these steps ensure your app focuses on retrieving public data from Facebook pages without requiring unnecessary user login.**

**Key Point:**

The image you sent appears to be a screenshot of a settings page from a different application, possibly unrelated to Facebook development. It doesn't directly correspond to the steps mentioned in the text about configuring a Facebook developer app.
